        Harry Edward Styles was born on February 1, 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire. In 2010, Harry auditioned as a solo contestant for the British signing competition: X-Factor. After failing to progress throughout the competition, we was placed in a group with four other members, which later became known as One Direction. In January of 2011, the band signed a contract with Syco Records and went on to be one of the best-selling boy bands of all time, selling 70 million records worldwide. In 2015, the group confirmed they were going on an extended hiatus, thus leading into Harry's solor career. He signed a contract with Columbia Records in 2016 as a solo artist. In 2017, his debut single, "Sign of the Times", went number one on UK Singles Charts and was ranked Rolling Stones' best song of 2017. This was followed by the release of his first album, "Harry Styles", where it debuted at number one in several countries including the UK and US. The album was influenced by 1970's soft rock. Styles embarked on his first headlining tour in September 2017, performing across the globe. His second album, Fine Line, was released in December of 2019. The album debuted at number three in the UK and was on top of the US charts. It broke the record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist. Rolling Stones ranked it at 491 in their "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". He scheduled a tour for Fine Line to take place in 2020, but had to postpone the tour to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
